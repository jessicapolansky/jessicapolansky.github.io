<a id="Overview"><h4>Overview</h4></a>
<p class= "para">Hero.RPG is a text-based game where you kill monsters to obtain gold. 
    The gold can then be used to purchase weapon upgrades or potions at the town shop.</p>
<a id="Game Play"><h4>Game Play</h4></a>
<p class = "para">This game is based on encounters and multiple-choice decision making. 
As you encounter new creatures, you can choose to:
<ol>
    <li>Fight!</li>
    <li>Stand very still.
    <li>Bravely flee.</li>
    <li>Head to the shop.</li>
</ol></p>
<a id="Hero Types"><h4>Hero Types</h4></a>
<div class = "para">
<p>There are currently 2 types of hero that you can choose to play.
    Each has their own unique abilities that make gameplay interesting.
    <h5>Warrior</h5>
    <p>The warrior is your most basic hero type. He can do basic attacks 
        with 5 power and has a starting 10 health. However, upon attacking, there is 
        a ~20% chance the attack will cause 2x damage.
    </p>
    <h5>Medic</h5>
    <p>The medic is similar to your most basic hero type, starting with 5 power and 10 health. 
        In addition to the basic attacks, there is a ~20% chance for a 'bandaid' to be used that
        heals the medic for 2 points. A current glitch in the code actually allows you to heal above full health!
